## Optimization model & optimizable epidemic model:

This model set will allow optimization of epidemic mitigation policies. NOT IN WORKING ORDER YET! (Jul 24, 2020)

Files:
- policy_epidemic_model_code.py
- policy_optimizer.py

## Epidemic model without optimization:

This model can be used to simulate different testing scenarios (vary testing rate, sensitivity, specificity)

- model_code.py
- Covid_Imperfect_Testing.ipynb


## Utilities:
Files: 
- jupyterWidgets.py - used in jupyter notebooks to allow parameter setting
