# To Do

Think about false positives: Now they mostly stay as false positives until vaccination as r^+ = 0. Some of them get sick and exit the state like that. Should they maybe have a release rate back to NA, NQ? Because: If you're identified as false positive but don't develop symptoms for a long time, you'd probably be retested or released as 'healed' (even though you'd not have immunity). This large amount of quarantined false positives creates a large reduction effect on the epidemic.

Add 'perfect_testing_basecase' for background. 

Implement sliders for sensitivity and specificity
